### Hi there üëã

My name is Ay√¥n Garc√≠a, and I am a joung resercher in the Atacama University and PhD student in the [Geological Science] at the University of Cordoba. My research focuses on future spatio-temporal forecasting, with applications on forecasting for autonomous vehicles. My research interests include graph cryosphere, hidrology, geophysics and climate change.

Prior to my PhD, I received a Diploma in Geology from the Atacama University. For my Diploma thesis, I researched the topic of glacier and periglacial environment.
